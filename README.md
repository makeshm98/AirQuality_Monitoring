# AirQuality_Monitoring
* Air quality monitoring involves measuring the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 
* This monitoring helps assess the level of pollution, identify potential health risks, and guide environmental policies.
* Real-time data from air quality sensors and monitoring systems provide valuable insights into pollution trends, enabling actions to improve air quality..

# Indoor CO2 monitoring
* Indoor CO2 monitoring involves tracking the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in indoor spaces, such as homes, offices, and industrial environments.
* Elevated CO2 levels can indicate poor ventilation, which may lead to discomfort, reduced cognitive function, and in extreme cases, health issues.
* By using CO2 sensors, real-time monitoring can provide valuable insights into air quality and ventilation efficiency.
* This data allows for adjustments to HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems to maintain a healthy and comfortable indoor environment, promoting better air circulation and improving overall well-being.
* Regular indoor CO2 monitoring is particularly important in spaces with limited airflow or high occupancy.

# BME688 
## BME688 Forced Mode operation
* In forced mode, temperature, pressure, humidity and gas conversion are performed sequentially for 1 heater temperature step and heating duration.
* This low level driver code for BME688 is used for enabling customized heater profile step (0 to 9) for calibration purpose.
* This library code uses SPI functionalities.
