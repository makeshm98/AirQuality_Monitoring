# AirQuality_Monitoring
* Air quality monitoring involves measuring the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 
* This monitoring helps assess the level of pollution, identify potential health risks, and guide environmental policies.
* Real-time data from air quality sensors and monitoring systems provide valuable insights into pollution trends, enabling actions to improve air quality..
